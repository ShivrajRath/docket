# docket

**Your day, compiled.**

Docket is a cognitive task management dashboard for Obsidian designed to bridge the gap between **strategic thinking** and **immediate execution**. It replaces traditional linear to-do lists with a flexible, two-column Kanban system that adapts to your workflow.

## 🧠 The Philosophy

In the "Two Hat" workflow:

- **Hat 1: The Strategist** - High-level sections (Learning, Admin, Backlog). This is your conceptual workspace where you organize _what_ needs to be done, not _when_.
- **Hat 2: The Operator** - "Today" and "Next". This is your execution engine. Time is the only resource here, so tasks must be specific and actionable.

Docket ensures you never lose sight of the big picture while staying focused on shipping today's work.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Responsive Section Grid**: Drag-and-drop sections (Today, Next, Waiting, Focus Hub, Learning, Ideas, Watch, etc.) to organize your workflow. Sections can be reordered and customized with icons and colors.

- **Smart Capture**: Type or paste anything into the Quick Capture bar. Use inline syntax `#tag` to instantly categorize tasks. Tag suggestions appear as you type with keyboard navigation support.

- **Semantic Tagging**: Define custom tags (e.g., `#DeepWork`, `#Architecture`, `#Data`) with unique colors to filter your entire view on the fly via clickable tag pills.

- **Task Reminders**: Set reminders on individual tasks with date/time pickers. Overdue reminders are visually highlighted.

- **Waiting Time Counters**: Enable time counters on specific sections (like "Waiting") to track how long tasks have been waiting.

- **Daily Dump**: A dedicated scratchpad for "brain dumping" without breaking your flow. Features markdown preview, debounced auto-save, and optional sync to Obsidian Daily Notes or Periodic Notes.

- **Archive**: A time-filtered history of completed tasks, grouped by month with search functionality. Restore tasks back to active sections with one click.
