# Docket

**Your day, compiled.**

Docket is a cognitive task management dashboard for Obsidian designed to bridge the gap between **strategic thinking** and **immediate execution**. It replaces traditional linear to-do lists with a flexible, visual multiple group system that adapts to your workflow.

## 🧠 The Philosophy

In the "Two Hat" workflow:

- **Hat 1: The Strategist** - High-level sections (Learning, Admin, Backlog). This is your conceptual workspace where you organize _what_ needs to be done, not _when_.
- **Hat 2: The Operator** - "Today" and "Next". This is your execution engine. Time is the only resource here, so tasks must be specific and actionable.

Docket ensures you never lose sight of the big picture while staying focused on shipping today's work.

2. **Open Docket** via the ribbon icon or `Ctrl+P` → "Open Docket dashboard"
3. **Start capturing tasks** using the Quick Capture bar at the top
4. **Organize your workflow** by dragging sections and tasks to fit your needs

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Workflow Optimization

**1. Use the Two-Hat System Effectively**

- Keep strategic sections (Learning, Ideas, Backlog) separate from execution sections (Today, Next)
- Review your strategic sections weekly and move actionable items to Today/Next
- Use the "Waiting" section for tasks blocked on external dependencies

**2. Leverage Tag Filtering for Focus**

- Create tags for different work modes: `#DeepWork`, `#Admin`, `#Communication`
- Filter by `#DeepWork` during focus sessions to eliminate distractions
- Use `#Urgent` for time-sensitive items that need attention

**3. Optimize Section Layout**

- Resize sections based on your typical task volume
- Wider sections for high-volume areas like "Today"
- Narrower sections for reference areas like "Ideas"
- Order sections left-to-right by priority or workflow stage

**4. Use Section Descriptions**

- Add clear descriptions to each section explaining its purpose
- Include 4 practical examples in the section settings
- This helps maintain consistency when adding new tasks

### Task Management

**5. Quick Capture Best Practices**

- Use inline tags when capturing: `Review PR #DeepWork #CodeReview`
- Be specific with task descriptions to make them actionable
- Use the Quick Capture bar as a scratchpad - type and press Enter quickly

**6. Smart Reminder Usage**

- Set date-only reminders for recurring tasks (weekly reviews, monthly reports)
- Use specific time reminders for time-sensitive deadlines
- Overdue reminders are visually highlighted - check these daily

**7. Archive as a Learning Tool**

- Review your Archive monthly to identify patterns in your work
- Use the search function to find similar completed tasks
- Restore tasks when similar work comes up again

### Advanced Techniques

**8. Multi-Tag Filtering**

- Combine tags for precise filtering: `#DeepWork` + `#Backend` for backend focus sessions
- This is powerful for specialized work modes or project-specific filtering

**9. Waiting Time Tracking**

- Enable counters on "Waiting" sections to track response times
- Use this data to identify bottlenecks in your workflow
- Follow up on tasks that have been waiting too long

**10. Section Color Coding**

- Use colors to indicate section types: red for urgent, blue for strategic, green for active
- This creates visual hierarchy and makes scanning faster

**11. Keyboard Shortcuts**

- Use `Ctrl+P` → "Open Docket dashboard" for quick access
- Press `Escape` in Quick Capture to clear filters and blur input
- Use arrow keys to navigate tag suggestions when typing

**12. Context Menu Power**

- Right-click any task to access all available actions
- Move tasks between sections quickly via the context menu
- Toggle tags directly from the context menu without editing

### Maintenance

**13. Regular Reviews**

- Weekly: Review strategic sections and move items to execution
- Monthly: Clean up Archive and review completed work patterns
- Quarterly: Reassess your section structure and tag taxonomy

**14. Tag Hygiene**

- Keep your tag list focused and meaningful
- Remove unused tags periodically
- Consider tag hierarchy (e.g., `#Work/Backend`, `#Work/Frontend`)
